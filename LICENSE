wimlib library written by Eric Biggers
Copyright (C) 2012-2018 Eric Biggers


Unless otherwise specified, wimlib and its associated programs, scripts,
documentation, and other files may be redistributed and/or modified under the
terms of the GNU General Public License; either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.  There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted
by law.  See the file LICENSE.GPLv3 for more details.

Alternatively, when not prohibited by conflict with a third-party software
license, the library portion of wimlib may be redistributed and/or modified
under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License; either version 3 of
the License, or (at your option) any later version.  There is NO WARRANTY, to
the extent permitted by law.  See the file LICENSE.LGPLv3 for more details.

NOTE! The primary reason for the GPL/LGPL "dual licensing" for the library is
that on UNIX-like systems, wimlib can optionally be linked to the third-party
library "libntfs-3g", which is licensed GPLv2+.  Under some interpretations of
the GPL, this would require that wimlib be licensed under the GPL as well.
However, a binary copy of wimlib that was compiled without libntfs-3g support
(for example; the exception may be applicable in other situations as well)
logically cannot be affected by libntfs-3g's license and should therefore be
free to be redistributed under the LGPL instead of the GPL.
